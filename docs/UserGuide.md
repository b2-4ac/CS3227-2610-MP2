# HotShop User Guide

## Requirements

Install Java 25. A graphical desktop is required.

## Start HotShop

From the project directory on Windows:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat run
```

On macOS/Linux, use `./gradlew run` (run `chmod +x gradlew` first if needed).
The first build downloads dependencies and requires internet access.

HotShop opens the **Log in** page in an 1100 by 750 window. The minimum window
size is 960 by 640 (JavaFX layout units). Pages and the sidebar scroll when
needed; listing grids wrap to fewer columns in narrower windows.

Pages and dialogs use a warm light theme with ivory backgrounds, white panels,
burnt-orange accents, and no shadows. Keyboard focus is shown with an outline.
Conversations use the same theme: unread badges use the orange accent, and your
own messages have a soft warm background to distinguish them from replies.

Startup creates or opens a local database and image folder at `.hotshop` in your
home directory. Accounts, listings, offers, and images in that folder survive
application restarts. Only one HotShop instance may use the same folder at a time.
Opening an older HotShop data folder upgrades it automatically without removing
existing accounts.

If startup fails, HotShop displays an error and exits without resetting existing
data. Check folder permissions and close another running HotShop instance before
retrying. Close HotShop before backing up its entire data folder, including images.

## Run the packaged application

Build on the operating system and architecture where the JAR will run:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat shadowJar
java -jar release/HotShop.jar
```

The JAR includes JavaFX libraries for the build machine's platform, but does not
include Java itself. The CI artifact targets Linux.

## Accounts and navigation

Choose **Create an account** to register with a username, display name, password,
and password confirmation. Registration returns to login with your username
filled in. Password visibility checkboxes let you inspect what you typed.
After login, the Search page opens. Every user can both buy and sell; the sidebar's
Buying and Selling headings organise pages and do not switch account roles.

Use **My Profile** to save your display name and private preferred pickup location.
Your username cannot be changed. **Replace Image** and **Remove Image** save
separately from the text fields. **Change Password** requires your current password
and matching new passwords; it keeps you logged in. Clicking another participant's
name/photo opens their public profile with their available listings, newest first.
Your own identity link opens My Profile instead.

Use **Back** to return through pages and **Log out** to end the session. Leaving a
listing editor or profile with unsaved text changes asks whether to discard them;
the same protection applies to logout and closing the window. Wait for an active
operation to finish before navigating or closing.

## Search and listings

Search starts with guidance and no results. Enter a title query and press Enter
or **Search**. An empty query searches all eligible listings from other sellers.
Open **Filters** for category, conditions, and minimum/maximum SGD price. Query
and filter changes take effect only on submission. Sorting reorders the last
submitted results immediately. **Clear Filters** does not submit; **Refresh**
reruns the last submitted search. Back navigation retains draft fields and the
submitted search, sorting, and scroll position. A new login resets search.

For example, search for `desk`, choose Furniture, and set a maximum price of
`50.00`. Matching listing cards show a photo or placeholder, title, asking price,
and condition. Open a card to see all photos, the description, status, category,
condition, pickup location, and seller profile link. No matches and failed loads
have different messages; a failed load offers **Retry**.

Listing cards stay the same size when the window is resized: wider windows fit
more cards per row. Cards have aligned rows and prices, with two lines reserved
for the title. Titles that exceed two lines end with an ellipsis; open the card
to read the full title. Photos fit completely inside their frames without cropping.

Under Selling, **My Listings** shows your listings, status, and pending-offer counts;
condition is available on the detail page instead of these owner cards.
Choose **Create Listing**, enter the details, and optionally use **Add Photo**.
Photo previews have **Move Up**, **Move Down**, and **Remove** controls. New listings
prefill your preferred pickup location, which you can change for that listing.
Photos are validated before being added and revalidated when saved; the app
does not automatically crop or resize images.

Open one of your listings for **Edit Listing**, **Archive Listing**, **Delete
Listing**, and Incoming Offers. Actions unavailable in the listing's state are
disabled with an explanation. Saving actual changes with pending offers asks for
confirmation because those offers will be rejected. Archival and permanent deletion
also explain their consequences before proceeding.

## Offers and sales

On another seller's available listing, choose **Make Offer**, enter an SGD amount
with at most two decimal places, optionally add a message to the seller (up to
1,000 characters), and choose **Submit Offer**. The message appears in your
conversation with the seller. Your pending offer
then appears with **Withdraw Offer**; changing an amount requires withdrawing first.
**My Offers** contains your offer history and links to listings and accepted purchases.

Sellers accept or reject offers in the listing's Incoming Offers section.
**Accept Offer** asks for confirmation: it reserves the listing, creates an active
sale, and rejects competing pending offers. Accepted offers link to their sale.

**My Purchases** and **My Sales** show agreed sales, counterpart profiles, statuses,
and next steps. Open a sale to see its agreed title, description, condition, price,
confirmation timestamps, and cancellation history. Both participants must use
**Confirm Completion** after the handover; the second confirmation completes the
sale and marks the listing sold.

Before either confirmation, **Cancel Sale** releases the listing. After a
confirmation, use **Request Cancellation**: the other participant must accept or
reject it, and the requester can withdraw it. Pending requests block completion.
Confirmation, direct cancellation, and accepting cancellation explain their effects
in confirmation dialogs. Only currently permitted actions are enabled.

The seller **Dashboard** summarises pending offers, active/completed sales, the
total agreed value of completed sales, and your upcoming meetups as a seller.

## Conversations

A conversation is between one buyer and the seller about one listing. Open one in
any of these ways:

- **Chat with seller** on another seller's listing. If you haven't talked about
  that listing yet, the page is empty; your first message starts the conversation.
- **Chat with buyer** beside an offer in your listing's Incoming Offers.
- **Open Chat** on a sale's details, for either of you.
- **Conversations** in the sidebar, which lists every conversation, buying or
  selling. When you have unread items, the link shows the total, for example
  **Conversations (2)**.

The Conversations page puts conversations with a pending offer or an active sale
under **Offers and sales**, and the rest under **Other conversations**. Each card
shows the listing, the other person, whether you're buying or selling, a preview,
and how many unread items it has. Choose the listing title to open it, or
**Refresh** to reload the list.

A conversation page shows the other person, the listing's status, and **View
Listing** at the top. Below that, one bar shows the latest stage of the deal.
Until the two of you have a sale, it shows the buyer's latest offer:

- A pending offer: the buyer can **Withdraw Offer**, and the seller can **Accept
  Offer** (with the same confirmation as Incoming Offers, then Sale Details opens)
  or **Reject Offer**.
- A rejected or withdrawn offer, or no offer: the buyer can **Make Offer** while
  the listing is available. After a cancelled sale, the bar shows the offer again
  ("Accepted · Sale Cancelled").

During an active sale the bar shows the meetup instead (see Meetups below), and
after a completed sale it shows "Sale completed" and where you met. **View Sale**
is always there once you have a sale.

Messages appear oldest first; yours are on the right. Type in the box at the
bottom and press **Enter** or choose **Send**; **Shift+Enter** adds a new line. The
counter shows how many of the 1,000 characters you've used. If a message can't be
sent, the reason appears below the box and your text is kept. Leaving the page
with an unsent message asks whether to discard it.

Once a listing is sold or archived, its conversations stay readable but the send
box is disabled with the reason. On a sold or archived listing you haven't asked
about, **Chat with seller** is disabled, because conversations can only be started
about available or reserved listings.

Only one person is logged in at a time, so you see the other person's replies the
next time you log in.

## Meetups

You arrange where and when to hand over the item inside the sale's conversation;
there is no separate meetup page. Open the conversation with **Open Chat** on the
sale, or from **Conversations**. During an active sale, the bar at the top of the
conversation shows the meetup:

1. **The seller offers times.** Choose **Offer Time**, pick a date (today to 60
   days ahead), a start time, a length (15 minutes to 4 hours), and a place, which
   starts as the listing's pickup location. Each **Offer Time** adds one time; you
   can offer up to 3. **View Times** lists them, each with **Withdraw**.
2. **The buyer chooses one.** The buyer sees "n times offered" and **Choose Time**,
   which lists the times, each with **Book**. Booking removes the other times.
3. **Once booked**, the bar shows the time and place, for example "Meetup: Fri 2 Oct
   2026, 14:00 to 14:30 · Library lobby". Either of you can:
   - **Propose Move**: the same form, starting from the current meetup. The other
     person sees your proposal with **Accept Move** and **Reject Move**; you see it
     with **Withdraw Proposal**.
   - **Cancel Meetup**: asks you to confirm. The sale stays active, and the seller
     can offer new times.

When the booked time has passed, the bar asks you to confirm completion on the
sale if the handover happened. Completing the sale shows "Sale completed · Met on
..." in the bar. If a time can't be offered or booked (for example, it has already
started or overlaps another of your meetups), the reason appears and nothing
changes.

The meetup also appears as one line on each active sale in **My Sales** and **My
Purchases**, and on reserved listings in **My Listings**, for example "2 times
offered" or "No meetup times yet". A sale's **Sale Details** page shows the same
text as the conversation's bar. Completed sales that had a meetup show where you
met ("Met on ...").
Listing cards retain their status and pending-offer footer above the meetup
summary. Long summaries are shortened with an ellipsis to fit the fixed card;
open the sale or its conversation to read the full meetup details.

## Feedback and unfinished features

Forms retain input after errors and show field-specific validation where possible.
Loading indicators show work in progress and prevent repeat submissions. Routine
profile and password saves use inline success messages. Empty collections explain
what to do next, such as creating a listing or searching for items.

Wishlist and notifications have no screens yet. Their navigation entries and
relevant contextual controls are disabled and labelled **Coming soon**. They do not
open placeholder feature screens.

## Marketplace rules

The account service enforces these rules:

- Registration requires a unique username, display name, and password. Usernames
  use 3-30 ASCII letters, digits, or underscores and are case-insensitively unique.
  Usernames cannot be changed. Display names contain 1-80 Unicode code points.
- Passwords contain 8-128 Unicode code points, including an ASCII uppercase letter,
  lowercase letter, digit, and punctuation character. Spaces are allowed but do
  not count as punctuation. Password case and whitespace are preserved exactly.
- Registration leaves the user logged out. Restarting also logs out; switching
  users requires logout. Password changes require the current password and retain
  the current session. Password recovery and account deletion are not available.
- Display name and optional preferred pickup location save together. A provided
  location contains 1-200 Unicode code points; it can also be cleared. Location
  preferences are private. Other logged-in users receive only display name and
  image through public-profile access.
- Profile images must contain readable JPEG or PNG data, be at most 5 MiB, and
  measure at most 512 pixels wide and 512 pixels high. Rectangular images are
  accepted. Images are not resized or cropped automatically.
- Image changes save separately from text details. HotShop copies imported images
  into its data folder; moving the original photo afterward does not affect the
  saved copy. Replacing or removing an image never deletes the original photo.
  Failed saves preserve the prior image. Failed cleanup is retried at startup.

The listing service enforces these rules. Every listing action requires login.

- A listing needs a title (1-120 characters), description (1-5,000 characters),
  category, condition, pickup location (1-200 characters), and a price from
  S$0.01 to S$1,000,000. Categories are Electronics, Books, Clothing, Furniture,
  Sports, and Other; conditions are New, Like new, Good, Fair, and Poor.
- A listing may have 0 to 10 photos in a chosen order. Each photo must contain
  readable JPEG or PNG data, be at most 10 MiB, and measure at most 4096 pixels
  wide and high. Photos are not resized. HotShop copies them into its data
  folder, so moving or deleting the original photo does not affect the listing.
  If any photo is rejected, nothing about the listing changes.
- Sellers see all of their own listings, in every status: reserved listings
  first (they are waiting for a handover), then available, sold, and archived,
  each newest first. Each listing shows how many pending offers it has; open the
  listing to see the offers themselves.
- Only the seller can edit, archive, or delete a listing. Only available
  listings can be edited; saving without any change does not count as an edit.
- **Editing a listing rejects all of its pending offers**, because the buyers
  offered on the old details. Saving without any change keeps them.
- Archiving hides an available or sold listing from search but keeps it, and
  people with a link to it can still open it. Archived listings cannot be
  reopened. **Archiving also rejects all pending offers.** A reserved listing
  cannot be archived.
- Deleting permanently removes an available or archived listing and its photos.
  Reserved and sold listings cannot be deleted, and neither can any listing that
  has ever received an offer, even one that was later withdrawn, or that a buyer
  has messaged you about; archive it instead.
- Search shows only other sellers' available listings. It can match text in the
  title (ignoring upper and lower case), and filter by one category, one or more
  conditions, and a minimum and/or maximum price (both inclusive). Results are
  sorted newest first, or by price from low to high or high to low.

The offer service enforces these rules. Every offer action requires login.

- Buyers can offer from S$0.01 to S$1,000,000.00 on another seller's available
  listing. Offers may be above the asking price. You cannot offer on your own
  listing, or on a listing that is reserved, sold, or archived.
- You can have only one pending offer on each listing. To change the amount,
  withdraw your offer and make a new one. Only pending offers can be withdrawn.
- Buyers see all of their own offers, newest first, with each listing's current
  status. Other buyers never see your offer or its amount.
- Sellers see every offer on their own listing: the accepted offer first, then
  the others newest first.
- Accepting an offer reserves the listing and automatically rejects every other
  pending offer on it. Only pending offers can be accepted or rejected, and only
  by the seller.
- Every refused action explains what went wrong and what to do next, for
  example: "You already have a pending offer of S$40.00 on this listing.
  Withdraw it before making a new one."
- Making an offer also starts your conversation with the seller about that
  listing, or continues it, so the seller can always reply to you. An optional
  message written in the Make Offer dialog becomes a message in that
  conversation.

The sale service enforces these rules. Every sale action requires login, and
only the sale's buyer and seller can see or act on it.

- Accepting an offer creates an **active sale**: the item is reserved while you
  meet and hand it over. After the handover, the buyer and seller each confirm
  completion. When both have confirmed, the sale is complete and the listing is
  sold. Completed sales are final.
- Before anyone confirms, either of you can cancel the sale. The listing becomes
  available again; offers that were rejected when the sale was agreed stay
  rejected, so buyers make new offers.
- After one of you has confirmed, cancelling needs agreement: send a
  cancellation request. While it is pending, neither of you can confirm. The
  other person can accept it (the sale is cancelled and the listing released) or
  reject it (the sale continues and earlier confirmations stay). You can
  withdraw your own request. Only one request can be pending at a time.
- Sellers see **My Sales** and buyers see **My Purchases**: one entry per agreed
  sale, with sales waiting for a response to a cancellation request first, then
  other active sales, completed, and cancelled sales, each newest first. A
  listing appears twice in My Sales only if an earlier sale of it was cancelled.
- Each entry says what to do next, such as "Offer meetup times" or "Respond to
  the other participant's cancellation request", and which actions are available.
- The sales dashboard shows your pending offers across all your listings, your
  active and completed sales, and the total value of completed sales. Active
  sales are not included in the total because they can still be cancelled. The
  dashboard also counts your upcoming meetups as a seller: booked meetups that
  have not started yet.

The meetup service enforces these rules. Every meetup action requires login, and
only the sale's buyer and seller can see or act on its meetup.

- Meetups are arranged for an active sale. The seller offers the buyer up to 3
  meetup times, each with a start, an end, and a pickup location (1-200
  characters). A time lasts 15 minutes to 4 hours, starts in the future, and
  starts at most 60 days ahead. A sale's offered times cannot overlap each other,
  or any meetup the seller already has.
- Only the buyer books, by choosing one of the offered times. Booking deletes the
  sale's other offered times. Neither of you can book a time that overlaps
  another meetup you already have, whether you are buying or selling in it. If
  the seller offered the same time to two buyers, whoever books first gets it.
- The seller can withdraw an offered time that nobody has booked. Offered times
  cannot be edited, and times that have already started are no longer shown.
- Either of you can propose moving a booked meetup to a new time and place. The
  other person accepts (the meetup moves) or rejects (it stays as booked), and
  you can withdraw your own proposal. Only one proposal can be pending at a time.
- Either of you can cancel a booked meetup. The sale stays active, so the seller
  offers new times and the buyer books again.
- Completing the sale completes its meetup, and cancelling the sale cancels it.
  You can confirm completion with or without a meetup. A meetup whose time has
  passed stays booked, and the next step becomes "Did the handover happen?
  Confirm completion".
- Each sale in My Sales and My Purchases, and each reserved listing, shows its
  offered times or booked meetup as one line.
- Every refused action explains what went wrong, for example: "The seller
  already has a meetup from Fri 25 Sep, 3:00 PM to Fri 25 Sep, 3:30 PM. Choose a
  different time."

The chat service enforces these rules. Every chat action requires login, and only
a conversation's buyer and seller can read it.

- Each buyer has at most one conversation with the seller about each listing.
  Only the buyer starts it, by sending the first message ("Chat with seller") or
  by making an offer. You can't message yourself about your own listing.
- A buyer can start a conversation about an available or reserved listing, for
  example to ask about a reserved item in case its sale falls through.
- Sellers can open a conversation with any buyer who has started one, for
  example from an offer or a sale, but they can't start one themselves.
- Messages are plain text of 1 to 1,000 characters. They can't be edited or
  deleted, and a message never accepts or changes an offer, even if it says
  "I accept".
- Either of you can send messages while the listing is available or reserved.
  Once it's sold or archived, the conversation stays readable but no new messages
  can be sent. If a sale is cancelled, the listing is available again and you
  can keep messaging.
- Only one person is logged in to HotShop at a time, so the other person sees
  your message the next time they log in.
- Opening a conversation marks it as read. Each conversation shows how many
  unread items it has, and the total is shown for all your conversations. Unread
  items are the other person's messages, plus offer news you didn't cause: a new
  or withdrawn offer for the seller, and an accepted or rejected offer for the
  buyer (including offers rejected because the listing was edited or archived, or
  another offer was accepted).
- Your conversations are listed together, whether you're buying or selling.
  Conversations with a pending offer or an active sale come first, then the rest.
  Within each group, unread conversations come first, then the most recent.
- Each conversation shows the buyer's latest offer and its status, and a preview
  of the latest message or offer news, such as "Offer of S$40.00 accepted".
