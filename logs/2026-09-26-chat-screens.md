# Agent Interaction Log

## User Prompt

> ok lets start on whats left which is the UI, what is currently not implemented

The assistant checked the UI code against the services. Every chat and meetup
operation is unused by the screens. The disabled "Coming soon" entry points are
the Wishlist, Meetups, Availability & Meetups, Conversations, and Notifications
sidebar links; Chat with seller and Save to wishlist on listing details; and
Arrange Meetup and Upcoming meetups on the sale page and Dashboard. Meetup
summaries already returned by the sale and My Listings services are not shown,
and the Make Offer dialog has no message box. Wishlists have no service at all.

> lets start with chat screens

The assistant created branch `Chat-Screens` from `main` and loaded the
`grilling` and `domain-modeling` skills (the `grill-with-docs` flow). All rounds
below belong to one interview session on 2026-09-26.

### Round 1: ownership, scope, layout, entry points, offers, display, refresh

> 1. a 2. a 3. a 4. a 5. a 6. a 7. a 8. as described 9. a 10. a 11. a 12. a

Every recommendation was accepted:

- Q1: the user builds the whole chat UI for both roles, subject to the
  teammate's agreement, because it is one shared page.
- Q2: chat only. Meetups, "Arrange Meetup", and the two meetup sidebar entries
  stay disabled until the meetup milestone.
- Q3: two pages, a Conversations list and a Conversation page, using the
  existing Back navigation.
- Q4: "Chat with seller" opens the Conversation page; with no conversation yet
  it shows an empty history, a hint, and the send box, and the first send
  creates the conversation.
- Q5: "Chat with buyer" on Incoming Offers rows, "Open Chat" on Sale Details for
  both participants, and "Chat with seller" on listing details.
- Q6: an offer bar at the top of the conversation with Withdraw, Accept, Reject,
  or Make Offer, calling OfferService and reusing the existing dialogs.
- Q7: the Make Offer dialog gains an optional message box.
- Q8: list cards with title, profile link, Buying/Selling badge, preview,
  unread badge, and last-activity time, under "Offers and sales" and "Other
  conversations" headings; an empty state with Search Listings.
- Q9: messages oldest first with sender and time, own messages right-aligned
  and tinted, scrolled to the newest on open.
- Q10: read-only conversations keep the send box visible but disabled, with a
  reason.
- Q11: unsent text triggers the existing unsaved-changes guard.
- Q12: pages load fresh on open, the list has a Refresh button, and the sidebar
  shows "Conversations (n)", updated after every navigation.

### Round 2: header, where offer actions return, closed offers, send box, scrolling

> 13. as descrubed 14. a 15. as described 16. as described 17. b 18. as described

Agreed:

- Q13: the header shows the listing title, a profile link, a Buying/Selling
  badge, the listing status badge, and View Listing.
- Q14: Make Offer, Withdraw, and Reject from the chat reload the conversation;
  Accept goes to Sale Details as it does today.
- Q15: accepted offers show "Accepted · Sale <status>" with View Sale; rejected
  and withdrawn offers show their status, with Make Offer for the buyer when the
  listing is available; with no offer, the buyer sees Make Offer and the seller
  sees "No offer yet".
- Q16: a multi-line box with Send, a "0 / 1,000" counter, Send disabled while
  blank, Ctrl+Enter to send, service refusals shown beside the box with the
  text kept, and the box cleared and scrolled to the newest message on success.
- Q17: **deviates from the recommendation.** The messages get their own
  scrolling area, with the header, offer bar, and send box fixed in place. This
  makes the Conversation page the only page that does not scroll as a whole.
  Its layout at the minimum window height is taken to round 3.
- Q18: on a sold or archived listing, "Chat with seller" opens an existing
  conversation read-only; with none, it is disabled with an explanation.

### Round 3: layout at the minimum window height

> 19 a, is changing the default or minimum possible?

Agreed (Q19 a): compact fixed parts (badges, profile link, and View Listing on
one row beside the title; a one-row offer bar; a 3-line send box), with the
message area taking the remaining height and a 200 px floor, checked by
snapshots at 960 x 640 and 1100 x 750.

On the window size, the assistant found that it is two constants in
`MarketplaceUi`, asserted by `MarketplaceUiTest`, and recorded in the User
Guide, Developer Guide, and `UiDesignScope.md` (an agreed UI decision). This
laptop reports a 1280 x 800 screen at 150% scaling with a usable area of
1280 x 752, so the default height of 750 already nearly fills it. This was put
to the user as Q20.

> lets stick to a first, anytingn can be changed later on

Agreed (Q20 a): keep 1100 x 750 and 960 x 640. The assistant separately noted
that a 1366 x 768 screen at 100% scaling has about 728 px of usable height, less
than the default window height; this is outside the feature and is left for
the user to raise with the teammate. The frontier is empty and the user
accepted the consolidated design in `docs/ChatScreensDesign.md`, noting that
anything can be changed later.

### Implementation

> /implement

The assistant had proposed two test seams: screen journeys through the
existing `MarketplaceUiTest` (real JavaFX controls, temporary database, and
snapshots at 960 x 640 and 1100 x 750), and the offer bar's role and state rules
as a small pure class tested directly, like `SearchStateTest`. The user invoked
`/implement` in reply, which was taken as approval of both seams.

### Manual testing follow-up

> right now entr breaks new line, shift enter does nothing ctrl enter sends the message

That matched the agreed Q16 design, except that Shift+Enter did nothing,
because JavaFX's `TextArea` ignores it. The assistant asked whether to keep
Ctrl+Enter (and fix only Shift+Enter) or switch to the chat-app convention. The
user chose **Enter sends (Recommended)**: Enter sends, Shift+Enter adds a new
line, and Ctrl+Enter still sends. Two journeys were written first
(`messageInput_enterKey_sendsMessage`,
`messageInput_shiftEnter_addsNewLineWithoutSending`); both failed, then passed
after the send box's key filter was changed. `.\gradlew.bat test --tests
"hotshop.ui.*" checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` then passed with 22 journeys, 12
offer bar tests, and 3 search state tests. The User Guide and design document
were updated, and `release/HotShop.jar` was rebuilt for manual testing.

### Push and window-size question

> i have installed gh alr, lets lets push this but dont create a pr yet, the issue on screen, how is 750 > 768

The branch was pushed to `origin` (on this laptop, the team repository
`CS3227-2610-MP2-HotShop/CS3227-2610-MP2`) as `Chat-Screens`, tracking
`origin/Chat-Screens`; no pull request was opened. The assistant clarified the
earlier window-size note: 768 is the whole screen, but the taskbar leaves about
728 px usable on a 1366 x 768 screen at 100% scaling, and the stage's 750 px
height includes the title bar, so the default window extends under the taskbar.
Display scaling shrinks the usable height further (about 670 px for 1920 x 1080
at 150%). Capping the initial size to the screen's visual bounds was suggested
as a fix for the teammate to consider, outside this branch.

> i think the screen size is fine, when i launched it on my laptop it fits ok with a little bit of extra space before the dashboard

Decided: **keep the window size unchanged.** The window fits on the user's
laptop, consistent with its 752 px usable height. No issue was opened; smaller
or more heavily scaled screens remain untested.

### Pull request

> ok do that as well as a summary of what this milestone accomplished

Because the last full run came before the Enter-key change, the assistant
reran `.\gradlew.bat test checkstyleMain checkstyleTest check build shadowJar`:
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 4 minutes 50 seconds, 621 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0
skipped. It then opened
[pull request #13](https://github.com/CS3227-2610-MP2-HotShop/CS3227-2610-MP2/pull/13)
against `main`. The description, written for the teammate as reviewer,
summarises the milestone, lists the five shared changes to agree on (building
the buyer side of chat, the PR #9 screen changes, the `UiPage` and
`MarketplaceUi` additions, `ConversationSummary.isAboutOfferOrSale`, and the
updated registration test), and states that Linux CI has not run yet.

## Steps Taken

Interview:

- Read `MarketplaceUi`, `UiPage`, `OfferPages`, `SalePages`, `ListingPages`,
  `ConversationSummary`, `ChatService`, and the `Conversation` and `Message`
  models, and listed the existing JavaFX journey tests.
- Checked this laptop's screen size and the tests and docs tied to the window
  size before answering the window-size question.
- Wrote `docs/ChatScreensDesign.md` and updated it after each round.

Implementation, test first:

1. `OfferBar` (pure record) through `OfferBarTest`: six red-green cycles
   (seller pending, buyer pending, accepted with sale status, buyer rejected,
   seller with no offer, buyer with no offer). Four boundary tests (withdrawn on
   a reserved listing, no offer on a sold listing, seller rejected, accepted with
   an active sale) passed on their first run, because they guard behaviour the
   earlier cycles had already built.
2. Buyer's first message: the journey went red because "Chat with seller" was
   still a disabled "Coming soon" button. Built `MarketplaceUi.fixedPage`,
   `UiPage.setTitle`/`setHeadingExtras`/`fillHeight`/`describe`,
   `ConversationPage`, `ChatPages.withSeller`, the listing page's button, and
   `OfferPages.makeOffer`/`accept` callbacks.
3. Sidebar count and the Conversations list: red on the missing count; built the
   live sidebar link with `refreshUnreadCount`, `ChatPages.list`, and opening
   from the list. The existing registration test asserted the old disabled
   Conversations entry; the agreed design makes it live, so that assertion now
   checks the still-disabled Notifications entry.
4. Chat with buyer and Open Chat: red on the missing button; added
   `ChatPages.withBuyer`, the Incoming Offers button, and Sale Details' Open Chat.
5. Offer with a message: red on the missing dialog field; added the optional
   message to the Make Offer dialog.
6. Closed listings (sold conversation read-only with its completed sale; Chat
   with seller disabled on an archived listing): both passed on their first
   run, because steps 2 and 3 already covered them.
7. Draft guard: red (no confirmation shown); fixed by marking the page dirty.
- Added message, unread, and offer bar styles, and inspected the snapshots at
  960 x 640 and 1100 x 750.
- Updated the User Guide, Developer Guide, design document, UI Design Scope, and
  the architecture status line.
- Ran `/code-review` with separate Standards and Spec sub-agents and fixed the
  findings listed below.

## Reasoning Summary

- One person builds the whole conversation page, because both roles share it;
  splitting it would put two people in the same files.
- Meetups are left for their own milestone, keeping one feature per PR.
- Two full pages follow the existing navigation instead of a split view, which
  would leave about 715 px for both panes at the minimum width.
- Screens call ChatService and OfferService only, so the rules stay in one place.
- State-blocked actions stay visible and disabled with a reason, following the
  agreed UI rule.
- The window size stays unchanged: the compact layout fits 960 x 640, and a
  taller window would not fit smaller screens, including this laptop's usable
  1280 x 752.
- No new domain terms came up, so `CONTEXT.md` is unchanged. No ADR was needed;
  the decisions are easy to revisit.
- `OfferBar` is a pure record so its eight-cell table is tested without JavaFX,
  and the journeys only need to check that its actions are wired up.
- `ConversationPage` keeps one `TextArea` across reloads, so offer actions that
  reload the conversation never lose a draft.
- "Chat with seller" checks `getConversations` instead of
  `openChatWithSeller`, because opening a conversation marks it read.
- The sidebar count refreshes after every navigation, relying on the single
  service worker to run it after the new page's load.

### Review findings

Fixed:

- The list's grouping rule was copied from ChatService into the screen, against
  the spec's "no rules are reimplemented in the UI". It is now
  `ConversationSummary.isAboutOfferOrSale`, used by both.
- The send-box counter hard-coded "1,000"; it now formats `Message.MAX_LENGTH`.
- Two journeys each covered two behaviours; they are now four tests (accepting
  from the offer bar; Open Chat on an active sale; an offer with a message;
  withdrawing from the offer bar).
- The "Buying"/"Selling" label was duplicated; it is now `UiControls.role`.
- The normal and not-yet-started conversation views repeated the same five
  steps; they now share `showBody`.
- Added the missing Conversations list snapshot at 1100 x 750, and offer bar
  tests for a withdrawn offer on an available listing and an accepted offer with
  a cancelled sale.

Kept, and recorded in the design document's implementation notes: the amount
shown on every offer bar row and "No offer yet" beside Make Offer; the message
area also scrolling to the newest when its content grows; the dialog's message
length check mirroring its amount check; the listing page's conversation check
(explained in the Developer Guide). Not acted on as minor: the " · Sale
<status>" text shared with Incoming Offers, and the sale-status lookup that
mirrors `SalePages.forOffer`.

## Changes Made

- `docs/ChatScreensDesign.md`: new design document, now marked implemented with
  verification scope and implementation notes.
- New: `src/main/java/hotshop/ui/ChatPages.java`, `ConversationPage.java`,
  `OfferBar.java`; `src/test/java/hotshop/ui/OfferBarTest.java`.
- `MarketplaceUi`: `fixedPage`, the live Conversations link with its unread
  count, and `chats`.
- `UiPage`: heading row, `setTitle`, `setHeadingExtras`, `fillHeight`, and the
  shared `describe` for failure messages.
- `ListingPages`: Chat with seller, disabled with a hint on closed listings
  without a conversation.
- `OfferPages`: the optional message in Make Offer, Chat with buyer on
  Incoming Offers, and reusable `makeOffer` and `accept`.
- `SalePages`: Open Chat.
- `UiControls.role`; `styles.css`: message, unread, and offer bar styles.
- `service/ConversationSummary.isAboutOfferOrSale`, now used by `ChatService`
  instead of its private copy.
- `MarketplaceUiTest`: nine new journeys and the updated registration assertion.
- `docs/UserGuide.md` (new Conversations section, offer message, unfinished
  features), `docs/DeveloperGuide.md` (Chat screens section),
  `docs/UiDesignScope.md`, `HotShop_Architecture.md`.
- This log.

## Verification

- The interview changed no code, so no Gradle tasks ran then.
- Each red-green cycle ran its single test class or journey; results files
  were checked to confirm the tests actually ran.
- `.\gradlew.bat test --tests "hotshop.ui.*" checkstyleMain checkstyleTest`
  first failed Checkstyle on one line over 120 characters in `ChatPages`; after
  wrapping it passed, with 18 journeys, 10 offer bar tests, and 3 search state
  tests.
- After the review fixes, the UI tests and `ChatServiceTest` passed (20, 12, 3,
  and 60 tests); Checkstyle failed once on a 121-character Javadoc line in
  `ConversationSummary`, which was shortened, and then passed.
- Snapshots at 960 x 640 and 1100 x 750 were inspected: the fixed conversation
  layout fits at the minimum size with room to spare.
- `.\gradlew.bat test checkstyleMain checkstyleTest check build shadowJar`
  passed in 3 minutes 30 seconds on this laptop: 619 tests, 0 failures, 0
  errors, 0 skipped (counted from `build/test-results/test`), and
  `release/HotShop.jar` was rebuilt.
- The packaged JAR was not launched, and no manual click-through was done
  outside the automated JavaFX journeys.

## Final Output and Conclusion

Chat screens are implemented and committed on branch `Chat-Screens`, based on
`main` at `a8e86fa`, in four commits: "Share the conversation grouping rule",
"Add offer bar rules for conversations", "Add conversation screens for buyers
and sellers", and "Document the chat screens". The branch has not been pushed
and no pull request was opened. The teammate should agree
to the shared changes listed in the design document: building the buyer's side
of chat here, the changed PR #9 screens, the Make Offer message box, and the new
`ConversationSummary.isAboutOfferOrSale`.
